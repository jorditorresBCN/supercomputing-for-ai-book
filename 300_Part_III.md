# **Part III — The Intelligence Abstraction Layer**


This part introduces the core concepts of deep learning and the high-level frameworks used to build and train neural networks. Its purpose is not to provide an exhaustive treatment of machine learning algorithms, but to establish a shared vocabulary and practical foundation for the scalable training workflows explored in later parts.

Part III is intended as an entry point for readers coming from a systems or HPC background who may be less familiar with modern AI frameworks. 

Readers with substantial prior experience in deep learning may choose to focus only on selected sections or proceed directly to the scalability-oriented parts IV and V of the book.
