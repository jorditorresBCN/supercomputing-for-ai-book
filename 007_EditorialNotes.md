# Editorial Notes

* TOC
{:toc}


### Pedagogical and Structural Notes 

Readers may notice that certain transversal topics reappear across multiple chapters and parts of the book. This repetition is intentional.

Over many years, the material that forms this book has been used independently in different university courses, each with distinct objectives and student profiles. Rather than fragmenting the content into multiple specialized volumes, it was consolidated into a single coherent work designed for modular reuse.

As a result, some stylistic or contextual variations between chapters may be perceptible. These reflect the diverse instructional settings in which the material was originally developed. The primary goal throughout has been to provide practical, rigorous, and reusable guidance, even at the cost of minor stylistic uniformity.

### Disclaimer 

This book is intended exclusively for educational and research purposes.

While it includes practical examples, code, and execution guidelines, the author assumes no responsibility for any misuse, misinterpretation, or consequences arising from the application of the material in production or operational environments.

Readers are responsible for validating their implementations and ensuring that any use of the techniques described complies with applicable policies, regulations, and best practices. All content is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

### Note to the Second Edition 

This second edition is the direct result of the book’s active use in courses at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) during the most recent academic term.

Continuous analysis of the tasks, together with attentive and constructive feedback from students, made it possible to identify errors, clarify explanations, and improve the overall coherence of the material. Several sections were refined, expanded, or reorganized to better reflect how the book is used in practice.

This book is conceived as a living work that will continue to evolve through future editions. Feedback from readers—students, instructors, and practitioners alike—is not only welcome, but essential.



### Code, Updates, and Errata

All source code, job scripts, configuration files, and auxiliary material referenced in this book are available in a public GitHub repository:

This repository also serves as the central point for updates, corrections, and reported errata. Given the fast pace of evolution in both supercomputing and AI frameworks, readers are encouraged to consult the repository regularly.

While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and reproducibility, the book is conceived as a *living resource*. Updates may be issued to reflect changes in software ecosystems, best practices, or teaching needs.
