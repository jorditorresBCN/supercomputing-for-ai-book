# About The Author

Jordi Torres is Full Professor of Computer Architecture at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC Barcelona Tech), where for more than three decades he has contributed to the education of engineers and researchers in the field of advanced computing. Throughout his academic career, he has consistently combined teaching, research, and long-term technological vision, shaping how large-scale computing systems are understood, taught, and applied across generations.

He was a member of the founding team of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), where he created and led a research group within the Computer Science Department during its early years. From this position, he played an active role in defining strategic research directions in supercomputing, contributing to the consolidation of BSC as an international reference center. His work has been characterized by the early identification of major computing paradigms and by engaging with emerging technologies well before they became mainstream.

Over the last decade, this long-term trajectory has naturally converged at the intersection of Supercomputing and Artificial Intelligence. His teaching now focus on how large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures enable modern AI systems, with particular emphasis on distributed training, performance optimization, and the systems-level challenges posed by deep learning and Large Language Models.

Jordi Torres is currently Senior Researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and serves as Expert Advisor on HPC for AI to the center’s executive leadership. He is the author or co-author of more than 200 scientific publications and several influential books. His work reflects a sustained interaction between fundamental research, applied computing, and industry collaboration, consistently positioned at moments of significant technological transition in large-scale computing systems.
