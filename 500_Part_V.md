# **Part V — The Language Abstraction Layer**


This part is devoted to Large Language Models and their execution on supercomputing platforms. It introduces the conceptual foundations of LLMs and focuses on practical workflows for fine-tuning, optimization, and scaling using modern frameworks such as Hugging Face.

Part V can serve as an advanced entry point for readers with prior experience in AI development who wish to understand how LLM workloads interact with high performance computing systems. While it builds on concepts introduced earlier in the book, many sections can be approached independently, with earlier parts used as supporting references when needed.
