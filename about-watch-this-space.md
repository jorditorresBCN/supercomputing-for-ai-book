# About WATCH THIS SPACE (Barcelona)

This book is part of the WATCH THIS SPACE Book Series – Barcelona, a personal editorial imprint created to publish technically rigorous works in the fields of supercomputing and artificial intelligence, with a strong commitment to academic quality, pedagogical clarity, and long-term relevance.

The imprint originated in 2016, driven by a concrete need encountered in my university teaching: the lack of complete, formally structured books that could serve as high-quality teaching material for advanced technical courses. The objective was to produce educational resources with editorial standards comparable to those of traditional technical publishers, while avoiding some of the structural constraints typically associated with conventional publishing models.

This editorial approach makes it possible to retain full control over authorship, editorial decisions, and distribution, while simultaneously enabling open access to the material through the website <https://torres.ai>. As a result, books in the series can be freely used by students, educators, and practitioners, both within formal courses and for independent study.

An equally important aspect of the WATCH THIS SPACE philosophy is flexibility. In fast-evolving fields such as supercomputing and artificial intelligence, technical content can become outdated rapidly. For this reason, books in the series are conceived as living resources: they may transition between active maintenance, archival status, or withdrawal as technologies, best practices, and teaching needs evolve.

WATCH THIS SPACE does not exist in opposition to traditional publishers. On the contrary, many of the author’s previous books have been published by established technical and general-interest publishing houses, and those collaborations have been consistently enriching. This imprint serves as a complementary editorial instrument, designed to address specific needs arising from academic teaching while providing resources that have proven useful to a broader technical and scientific community.

At the time of publication, *Supercomputing for Artificial Intelligence* is the eighth book in the WATCH THIS SPACE series. This reflects its role as a long-term reference for courses and practitioners working at the intersection of High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence. A complete and up-to-date list of books in the series, together with their maintenance status, is available at: <https://torres.ai/watch-this-space-book-series>
